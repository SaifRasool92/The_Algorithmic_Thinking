Since we're measuring how quickly our runtime grows, we need to express our speed in terms of...something else. With $Big O$ notation, we use the size of the input, which we call \"n.\" So we can say things like the runtime grows \"on the order of the size of the input\" $(O(n))$ or \"on the order of the square of the size of the input\" $(O(n^2))$.\n","\n","3. **as the input gets arbitrarily large**—Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when $n$ is small but areeclipsed eventually by other stepsas $n$ gets huge. For $big O$ analysis, we care most about the stuff that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly eclipsed as $n$ gets very large.
